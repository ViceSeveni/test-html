    <p class="poem">
      Go placidly amid the noise
      and the haste, and remember what peace there
      may be in silence.<br>
      As far as possible, without surrender, be on good terms
      with all persons.<br><br>
      Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, <br>
      even to the dull and the ignorant; they too have their story.<br><br>
      Avoid loud and aggressive persons; they are vexatious to the spirit.<br><br>
      If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain or bitter, <br>
      for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.<br><br>
      Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. Keep interested in your own
      career, however humble;<br>
      it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.<br><br>
      Exercise caution in your business affairs, for the world is full of
      trickery.<br>
      But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons
      strive for high ideals, <br>
      and everywhere life is full of heroism.<br><br>
      Be yourself. Especially do not feign affection. Neither be cynical about
      love;<br>
      for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment, it is as perennial
      as the grass.<br><br>
      Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things
      of youth.<br><br>
      Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune.<br>
      But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings.
      Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.<br><br>
      Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself. You are a child of
      the universe<br>
      no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be
      here.<br><br>
      And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding
      as it should.<br>
      Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to
      be.<br><br>
      And whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of
      life, keep peace in your soul.<br>
      With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a
      beautiful world.<br><br>
      Be cheerful. Strive to be happy.</p>
