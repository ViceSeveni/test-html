    <p class="poem">
      Out of the night that covers me, <br>
      Black as the pit from pole to pole, <br>
      I thank whatever gods may be <br>
      For my unconquerable soul. <br>
      <br>
      In the fell clutch of circumstance <br>
      I have not winced nor cried aloud. <br>
      Under the bludgeonings of chance <br>
      My head is bloody, but unbowed. <br>
      <br>
      Beyond this place of wrath and tears <br>
      Looms but the Horror of the shade, <br>
      And yet the menace of the years <br>
      Finds and shall find me unafraid. <br>
      <br>
      It matters not how strait the gate, <br>
      How charged with punishments the scroll, <br>
      I am the master of my fate, <br>
      I am the captain of my soul. <br>
