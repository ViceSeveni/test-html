    <p class="poem">

         Titan! to whose immortal eyes <br>
         The sufferings of mortality, <br>
         Seen in their sad reality, <br>
         Were not as things that gods despise; <br>
         What was thy pity's recompense?<br>
         A silent suffering, and intense;<br>
         The rock, the vulture, and the chain,<br>
         All that the proud can feel of pain,<br>
         The agony they do not show,<br>
         The suffocating sense of woe,<br>
         Which speaks but in its loneliness,<br>
         And then is jealous lest the sky <br>
         Should have a listener, nor will sigh <br>
         Until its voice is echoless.
         <br>
         Titan! to thee the strife was given <br>
         Between the suffering and the will, <br>
         Which torture where they cannot kill; <br>
         And the inexorable Heaven, <br>
         And the deaf tyranny of Fate, <br>
         The ruling principle of Hate, <br>
         Which for its pleasure doth create <br>
         The things it may annihilate, <br>
         Refus'd thee even the boon to die: <br>
         The wretched gift Eternity <br>
         Was thine—and thou hast borne it well. <br>
         All that the Thunderer wrung from thee <br>
         Was but the menace which flung back <br>
         On him the torments of thy rack; <br>
         The fate thou didst so well foresee, <br>
         But would not to appease him tell; <br>
         And in thy Silence was his Sentence, <br>
         And in his Soul a vain repentance, <br>
         And evil dread so ill dissembled, <br>
         That in his hand the lightnings trembled. <br>
         <br>
         Thy Godlike crime was to be kind, <br>
         To render with thy precepts less <br>
         The sum of human wretchedness, <br>
         And strengthen Man with his own mind; <br>
         But baffled as thou wert from high, <br>
         Still in thy patient energy, <br>
         In the endurance, and repulse <br>
         Of thine impenetrable Spirit, <br>
         Which Earth and Heaven could not convulse, <br>
         A mighty lesson we inherit: <br>
         Thou art a symbol and a sign <br>
         To Mortals of their fate and force; <br>
         Like thee, Man is in part divine, <br>
         A troubled stream from a pure source; <br>
         And Man in portions can foresee <br>
         His own funereal destiny; <br>
         His wretchedness, and his resistance, <br>
         And his sad unallied existence: <br>
         To which his Spirit may oppose <br>
         Itself—and equal to all woes,
         And a firm will, and a deep sense, <br>
         Which even in torture can descry <br>
         Its own concenter'd recompense, <br>
         Triumphant where it dares defy, <br>
         And making Death a Victory. <br>
